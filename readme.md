### What's in the box

- **Blank Slate plugin** configures WordPress to be better universally.
- **This Website plugin** configures WordPress for this site. Settings go here so the site doesn't fall apart if the theme changes. Also needs a cleverer name.
- **Blank Slate theme** is a starting point for development. Rename it and go forth.
- **Cornerstone**, a CSS barebones framework.

### Blank Slate theme

I've not made a parent theme. This theme doesn't have recognizable styles or markup. It's meant to reduce the work required to build a custom theme, but you're still meant to build a custom theme. Perhaps making it a parent theme would allow us to update the Blank Slate theme independently of the child theme, but I don't trust that update to not break the child theme. Use Blank Slate theme to create entirely unique and self-contained themes.

### Cornerstone

This really could be its own project and repo, but I found it tedious to maintain separate repos and combine them everytime I wanted to start a new project. So I buried it here because I made all of this so I can do whatever the hell I want. Cornerstone is my reaction to Zurb's Foundation. I felt Foundation did way more than I needed and got in my way more often than it helped.
